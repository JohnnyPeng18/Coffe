A single set contains values of any immutable data type.\n\nCREATING SETS\n\n>> myset = {1, 2} # Directly assigning values to a set\n>> myset = set()  # Initializing a set\n>> myset = set(['a', 'b']) # Creating a set from a list\n>> myset\n{'a', 'b'}\n\n\nMODIFYING SETS\n\nUsing the add() function:\n\n>> myset.add('c')\n>> myset\n{'a', 'c', 'b'}\n>> myset.add('a') # As 'a' already exists in the set, nothing happens\n>> myset.add((5, 4))\n>> myset\n{'a', 'c', 'b', (5, 4)}\n\n\nUsing the update() function:\n\n>> myset.update([1, 2, 3, 4]) # update() only works for iterable objects\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 2, (5, 4), 3}\n>> myset.update({1, 7, 8})\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 3}\n>> myset.update({1, 6}, [5, 13])\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 13, 3}\n\n\nREMOVING ITEMS\n\nBoth the discard() and remove() functions take a single value as an argument and removes that value from the set. If that value is not present, discard() does nothing, but remove() will raise a KeyError exception.\n\n>> myset.discard(10)\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 13, 11, 3}\n>> myset.remove(13)\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 11, 3}\n\n\nCOMMON SET OPERATIONS Using union(), intersection() and difference() functions.\n\n>> a = {2, 4, 5, 9}\n>> b = {2, 4, 11, 12}\n>> a.union(b) # Values which exist in a or b\n{2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12}\n>> a.intersection(b) # Values which exist in a and b\n{2, 4}\n>> a.difference(b) # Values which exist in a but not in b\n{9, 5}\n\n\nThe union() and intersection() functions are symmetric methods:\n\n>> a.union(b) == b.union(a)\nTrue\n>> a.intersection(b) == b.intersection(a)\nTrue\n>> a.difference(b) == b.difference(a)\nFalse\n\nThese other built-in data structures in Python are also useful.\n\n=====Problem Statement=====\nGiven 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.\n\n=====Input Format=====\nThe first line of input contains an integer, M.\nThe second line contains M space-separated integers.\nThe third line contains an integer, N.\nThe fourth line contains N space-separated integers. \n\n=====Output Format=====\nOutput the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, one per line.\nPlease write a Python function None for the task.\n```python": [

            "To solve the problem of finding the symmetric difference between two sets and printing the result in ascending order, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the input values.\n2. Convert the input values into sets.\n3. Compute the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n4. Sort the symmetric difference.\n5. Print each element of the sorted symmetric difference.\n\nHere's the complete Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    M = int(data[0])\n    set_M = set(map(int, data[1:M+1]))\n    \n    N = int(data[M+1])\n    set_N = set(map(int, data[M+2:M+2+N]))\n    \n    sym_diff = set_M.symmetric_difference(set_N)\n    sorted_sym_diff = sorted(sym_diff)\n    \n    for num in sorted_sym_diff:\n        print(num)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Reading Input:**\n   - We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and then split it into a list of strings.\n   - The first element is the size of the first set `M`.\n   - The next `M` elements are the elements of the first set `set_M`.\n   - The element after the first set is the size of the second set `N`.\n   - The next `N` elements are the elements of the second set `set_N`.\n\n2. **Creating Sets:**\n   - We convert the appropriate slices of the input list into sets using `map(int, ...)` to convert the strings to integers.\n\n3. **Computing Symmetric Difference:**\n   - We use the `symmetric_difference` method to find elements that are in either `set_M` or `set_N` but not in both.\n\n4. **Sorting and Printing:**\n   - We sort the symmetric difference and print each element on a new line.\n\nThis function assumes that the input is provided via standard input, which is typical for competitive programming and some coding environments. If you are running this in a different environment, you might need to adjust the input method accordingly."

You have to generate a list of the first N fibonacci numbers, 0 being the first number. Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list.\n\nConcept\n\nThe map() function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. It takes two parameters: first, the function that is to be applied and secondly, the iterables.\nLet's say you are given a list of names, and you have to print a list that contains the length of each name.\n\n>> print (list(map(len, ['Tina', 'Raj', 'Tom'])))  \n[4, 3, 3]  \n\nLambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function.

It proves very handy in functional and GUI programming.\n\n>> sum = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c\n>> sum(1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nNote:\n\nLambda functions cannot use the return statement and can only have a single expression.

            "Sure, let's break down the task step by step and then implement the solution in Python.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We need a function to generate the first `N` Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Cube the Fibonacci Numbers**: Use the `map` function along with a `lambda` expression to cube each Fibonacci number.\n3. **Print the Result**: Print the list of cubed Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. **Fibonacci Function**: We'll create a function `fibonacci(n)` that returns a list of the first `N` Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Cubing with Map and Lambda**: We'll use `map` and `lambda` to cube each number in the list of Fibonacci numbers.\n3. **Print the Result**: Finally, we'll print the resulting list.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    \n    fibs = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])\n    return fibs\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    \n    fibs = fibonacci(N)\n    cubed_fibs = list(map(lambda x: x**3, fibs))\n    print(cubed_fibs)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Fibonacci Function**:\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return an empty list.\n   - If `n` is 1, return `[0]`.\n   - If `n` is 2, return `[0, 1]`.\n   - For `n > 2`, generate the Fibonacci sequence iteratively and append each new number to the list.\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n   - Read the input value `N`.\n   - Generate the first `N` Fibonacci numbers using the `fibonacci` function.\n   - Use `map` and `lambda` to cube each Fibonacci number.\n   - Print the resulting list of cubed Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this script, you would typically run it in an environment where you can provide input via standard input (e.g., a terminal or a coding competition platform). The script reads the input, processes it, and prints the output as specified.\n\nThis solution is efficient and leverages Python's functional programming capabilities with `map` and `lambda` to achieve the desired result concisely."

The rooms are numbered from $0$ to $9$ from left to right.\n\nThe hotel has two entrances \u2014 one from the left end, and another from the right end. When a customer arrives to the hotel through the left entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the left entrance. Similarly, when a customer arrives at the hotel through the right entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the right entrance.\n\nOne day, Amugae lost the room assignment list. Thankfully Amugae's memory is perfect, and he remembers all of the customers: when a customer arrived, from which entrance, and when they left the hotel. Initially the hotel was empty. Write a program that recovers the room assignment list from Amugae's memory.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line consists of an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$), the number of events in Amugae's memory.\n\nThe second line consists of a string of length $n$ describing the events in chronological order.

'0', '1', ..., '9': The customer in room $x$ ($0$, $1$, ..., $9$ respectively) leaves. \n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one empty room when a customer arrives, and there is a customer in the room $x$ when $x$ ($0$, $1$, ..., $9$) is given. Also, all the rooms are initially empty.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line, output the hotel room's assignment status, from room $0$ to room $9$.

First of all, all rooms are empty. Assignment status is 0000000000.  L: a customer arrives to the hotel through the left entrance. Assignment status is 1000000000.  L: one more customer from the left entrance. Assignment status is 1100000000.  R: one more customer from the right entrance. Assignment status is 1100000001.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nAyush is a cashier at the shopping center. Recently his department has started a ''click and collect\" service which allows users to shop online. \n\nThe store contains k items. n customers have already used the above service. Each user paid for m items. Let a_{ij} denote the j-th item in the i-th person's order.\n\nDue to the space limitations all the items are arranged in one single row.

We perform the following operation with it: replace pairs $(a_{2i+1}, a_{2i+2})$ with $(a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2})\\bmod 10$ for $0\\le i<2^{k-1}$. For every $i$ where $a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2}\\ge 10$ we get a candy! As a result, we will get a sequence of length $2^{k-1}$.\n\nLess formally, we partition sequence of length $2^k$ into $2^{k-1}$ pairs, each consisting of 2 numbers: the first pair consists of the first and second numbers, the second of the third and fourth $\\ldots$, the last pair consists of the ($2^k-1$)-th and ($2^k$)-th numbers. For every pair such that sum of numbers in it is at least $10$, we get a candy. After that, we replace every pair of numbers with a remainder of the division of their sum by $10$ (and don't change the order of the numbers).\n\nPerform this operation with a resulting array until it becomes of length $1$. Let $f([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2^k}])$ denote the number of candies we get in this process. \n\nFor example: if the starting sequence is $[8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]$ then:\n\nAfter the first operation the sequence becomes $[(8 + 7)\\bmod 10, (3 + 1)\\bmod 10, (7 + 0)\\bmod 10, (9 + 4)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[5, 4, 7, 3]$, and we get $2$ candies as $8 + 7 \\ge 10$ and $9 + 4 \\ge 10$.\n\nAfter the second operation the sequence becomes $[(5 + 4)\\bmod 10, (7 + 3)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9, 0]$, and we get one more candy as $7 + 3 \\ge 10$. \n\nAfter the final operation sequence becomes $[(9 + 0) \\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9]$. \n\nTherefore, $f([8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]) = 3$ as we got $3$ candies in total.\n\nYou are given a sequence of digits of length $n$ $s_1, s_2, \\ldots s_n$.

Where did the name come from? Let's briefly look at the Gapja system, which is traditionally used in Korea to name the years.\n\nThere are two sequences of $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_{n}$ and $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, t_3, \\ldots, t_{m}$. These strings contain only lowercase letters. There might be duplicates among these strings.\n\nLet's call a concatenation of strings $x$ and $y$ as the string that is obtained by writing down strings $x$ and $y$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the strings \"code\" and \"forces\" is the string \"codeforces\".\n\nThe year 1 has a name which is the concatenation of the two strings $s_1$ and $t_1$. When the year increases by one, we concatenate the next two strings in order from each of the respective sequences. If the string that is currently being used is at the end of its sequence, we go back to the first string in that sequence.\n\nFor example, if $n = 3, m = 4, s = ${\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}, $t =$ {\"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"}, the following table denotes the resulting year names. Note that the names of the years may repeat. [Image] \n\nYou are given two sequences of strings of size $n$ and $m$ and also $q$ queries. For each query, you will be given the current year. Could you find the name corresponding to the given year, according to the Gapja system?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n, m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 20$).\n\nThe next line contains $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{n}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$.\n\nThe next line contains $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{m}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$.\n\nAmong the given $n + m$ strings may be duplicates (that is, they are not necessarily all different).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 2\\,020$).\n\nIn the next $q$ lines, an integer $y$ ($1 \\le y \\le 10^9$) is given, denoting the year we want to know the name for.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ lines. For each line, print the name of the year as per the rule described above.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n10 12\nsin im gye gap eul byeong jeong mu gi gyeong\nyu sul hae ja chuk in myo jin sa o mi sin\n14\n1\n2\n3\n4\n10\n11\n12\n13\n73\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n\nOutput\nsinyu\nimsul\ngyehae\ngapja\ngyeongo\nsinmi\nimsin\ngyeyu\ngyeyu\nbyeongsin\njeongyu\nmusul\ngihae\ngyeongja\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example denotes the actual names used in the Gapja system.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nKevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is $\\operatorname{max}(0.3 x,(1 - \\frac{m}{250}) x - 50 w)$. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, where m_{i} (0 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, where w_{i} (0 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers h_{s} and h_{u} (0 \u2264 h_{s}, h_{u} \u2264 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n20 40 60 80 100\n0 1 2 3 4\n1 0\n\nOutput\n4900\n\nInput\n119 119 119 119 119\n0 0 0 0 0\n10 0\n\nOutput\n4930\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets $(1 - \\frac{119}{250}) = \\frac{131}{250}$ of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is $\\frac{131}{250}(500 + 1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500) = 3930$. Adding in 10\u00b7100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.\n\nMike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own. [Image] \n\nMike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that the magnets formed.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000) \u2014 the number of magnets. Then n lines follow. The i-th line (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) contains either characters \"01\", if Mike put the i-th magnet in the \"plus-minus\" position, or characters \"10\", if Mike put the magnet in the \"minus-plus\" position.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the single line of the output print the number of groups of magnets.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n10\n10\n10\n01\n10\n10\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4\n01\n01\n10\n10\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first testcase corresponds to the figure.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nMahmoud and Ehab continue their adventures! As everybody in the evil land knows, Dr. Evil likes bipartite graphs, especially trees.\n\nA tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (u, v) that belongs to the graph, u and v belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of n nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself.

When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well.
