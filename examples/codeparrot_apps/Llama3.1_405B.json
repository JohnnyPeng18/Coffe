    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\n=====Function Descriptions=====\nObjective\nToday, we're learning about a new data type: sets.\n\nConcept\n\nIf the inputs are given on one line separated by a space character, use split() to get the separate values in the form of a list:\n\n>> a = raw_input()\n5 4 3 2\n>> lis = a.split()\n>> print (lis)\n['5', '4', '3', '2']\n\nIf the list values are all integer types, use the map() method to convert all the strings to integers.\n\n>> newlis = list(map(int, lis))\n>> print (newlis)\n[5, 4, 3, 2]\n\nSets are an unordered bag of unique values. A single set contains values of any immutable data type.\n\nCREATING SETS\n\n>> myset = {1, 2} # Directly assigning values to a set\n>> myset = set()  # Initializing a set\n>> myset = set(['a', 'b']) # Creating a set from a list\n>> myset\n{'a', 'b'}\n\n\nMODIFYING SETS\n\nUsing the add() function:\n\n>> myset.add('c')\n>> myset\n{'a', 'c', 'b'}\n>> myset.add('a') # As 'a' already exists in the set, nothing happens\n>> myset.add((5, 4))\n>> myset\n{'a', 'c', 'b', (5, 4)}\n\n\nUsing the update() function:\n\n>> myset.update([1, 2, 3, 4]) # update() only works for iterable objects\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 2, (5, 4), 3}\n>> myset.update({1, 7, 8})\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 3}\n>> myset.update({1, 6}, [5, 13])\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 13, 3}\n\n\nREMOVING ITEMS\n\nBoth the discard() and remove() functions take a single value as an argument and removes that value from the set. If that value is not present, discard() does nothing, but remove() will raise a KeyError exception.\n\n>> myset.discard(10)\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 13, 11, 3}\n>> myset.remove(13)\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 11, 3}\n\n\nCOMMON SET OPERATIONS Using union(), intersection() and difference() functions.\n\n>> a = {2, 4, 5, 9}\n>> b = {2, 4, 11, 12}\n>> a.union(b) # Values which exist in a or b\n{2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12}\n>> a.intersection(b) # Values which exist in a and b\n{2, 4}\n>> a.difference(b) # Values which exist in a but not in b\n{9, 5}\n\n\nThe union() and intersection() functions are symmetric methods:\n\n>> a.union(b) == b.union(a)\nTrue\n>> a.intersection(b) == b.intersection(a)\nTrue\n>> a.difference(b) == b.difference(a)\nFalse\n\nThese other built-in data structures in Python are also useful.\n\n=====Problem Statement=====\nGiven 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.\n\n=====Input Format=====\nThe first line of input contains an integer, M.\nThe second line contains M space-separated integers.\nThe third line contains an integer, N.\nThe fourth line contains N space-separated integers. \n\n=====Output Format=====\nOutput the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, one per line.\nPlease write a Python function None for the task.\n```python": [

            "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nHere is a Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference():\n    # Read the number of elements in set M\n    M = int(input())\n    \n    # Read the elements of set M\n    set_M = set(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Read the number of elements in set N\n    N = int(input())\n    \n    # Read the elements of set N\n    set_N = set(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Calculate the symmetric difference\n    symmetric_diff = set_M.symmetric_difference(set_N)\n    \n    # Print the symmetric difference in ascending order\n    for num in sorted(symmetric_diff):\n        print(num)\n\nsymmetric_difference()\n```\n\nThis function reads the input, calculates the symmetric difference using the `symmetric_difference` method of the `set` class, sorts the result in ascending order using the `sorted` function, and prints each number on a separate line.\n\nNote that the `symmetric_difference` method returns a new set containing all elements that are in exactly one of the sets. This is equivalent to the union of the two sets minus their intersection.\n\nYou can also use the `^` operator to calculate the symmetric difference, like this:\n\n```python\nsymmetric_diff = set_M ^ set_N\n```\n\nThis is a more concise way to calculate the symmetric difference, but it does the same thing as the `symmetric_difference` method."

You have to generate a list of the first N fibonacci numbers, 0 being the first number. Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list.\n\nConcept\n\nThe map() function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. It takes two parameters: first, the function that is to be applied and secondly, the iterables.\nLet's say you are given a list of names, and you have to print a list that contains the length of each name.\n\n>> print (list(map(len, ['Tina', 'Raj', 'Tom'])))  \n[4, 3, 3]  \n\nLambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function. In simple words, it is a function that has only one line in its body. It proves very handy in functional and GUI programming.\n\n>> sum = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c\n>> sum(1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nNote:\n\nLambda functions cannot use the return statement and can only have a single expression. Unlike def, which creates a function and assigns it a name, lambda creates a function and returns the function itself. Lambda can be used inside lists and dictionaries. \n\n=====Input Format=====\nOne line of input: an integer N.\n\n=====Output Format=====\nA list on a single line containing the cubes of the first N fibonacci numbers.\nPlease write a Python function fibonacci(n) for the task.\n```python": [

The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using a simple iterative approach.\n2. The `map` function is used to apply a lambda expression to each Fibonacci number, cubing it in the process. The `lambda` expression is an anonymous function that takes a single argument `x` and returns its cube (`x ** 3`).\n3. The `list` function is used to convert the result of `map` to a list, which is then returned by the `fibonacci` function.\n4. The user input is read using the `input` function, converted to an integer using `int`, and passed to the `fibonacci` function.\n5. The result is printed to the console using `print`.\n\nExample use case:\n\nInput: `5`\nOutput: `[0, 1, 1, 8, 27]`\n\nNote that this implementation uses a simple iterative approach to generate Fibonacci numbers, which is not the most efficient method for large values of `n`. For larger values, you may want to consider using a more efficient algorithm, such as the matrix exponentiation method."

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nConsider a sequence of digits of length $2^k$ $[a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2^k}]$. We perform the following operation with it: replace pairs $(a_{2i+1}, a_{2i+2})$ with $(a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2})\\bmod 10$ for $0\\le i<2^{k-1}$. For every $i$ where $a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2}\\ge 10$ we get a candy! As a result, we will get a sequence of length $2^{k-1}$.\n\nLess formally, we partition sequence of length $2^k$ into $2^{k-1}$ pairs, each consisting of 2 numbers: the first pair consists of the first and second numbers, the second of the third and fourth $\\ldots$, the last pair consists of the ($2^k-1$)-th and ($2^k$)-th numbers. For every pair such that sum of numbers in it is at least $10$, we get a candy. After that, we replace every pair of numbers with a remainder of the division of their sum by $10$ (and don't change the order of the numbers).\n\nPerform this operation with a resulting array until it becomes of length $1$. Let $f([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2^k}])$ denote the number of candies we get in this process. \n\nFor example: if the starting sequence is $[8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]$ then:\n\nAfter the first operation the sequence becomes $[(8 + 7)\\bmod 10, (3 + 1)\\bmod 10, (7 + 0)\\bmod 10, (9 + 4)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[5, 4, 7, 3]$, and we get $2$ candies as $8 + 7 \\ge 10$ and $9 + 4 \\ge 10$.\n\nAfter the second operation the sequence becomes $[(5 + 4)\\bmod 10, (7 + 3)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9, 0]$, and we get one more candy as $7 + 3 \\ge 10$. \n\nAfter the final operation sequence becomes $[(9 + 0) \\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9]$. \n\nTherefore, $f([8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]) = 3$ as we got $3$ candies in total.\n\nYou are given a sequence of digits of length $n$ $s_1, s_2, \\ldots s_n$.

You are asked to speed up the process and determine how the final report will look like.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of commodities in the report and the number of managers, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_{i} (|a_{i}| \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the initial report before it gets to the first manager.\n\nThen follow m lines with the descriptions of the operations managers are going to perform. The i-th of these lines contains two integers t_{i} and r_{i} ($t_{i} \\in \\{1,2 \\}$, 1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n), meaning that the i-th manager sorts the first r_{i} numbers either in the non-descending (if t_{i} = 1) or non-ascending (if t_{i} = 2) order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n integers\u00a0\u2014 the final report, which will be passed to Blake by manager number m.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1\n1 2 3\n2 2\n\nOutput\n2 1 3 \nInput\n4 2\n1 2 4 3\n2 3\n1 2\n\nOutput\n2 4 1 3 \n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, the initial report looked like: 1 2 3. After the first manager the first two numbers were transposed: 2 1 3. The report got to Blake in this form.\n\nIn the second sample the original report was like this: 1 2 4 3. After the first manager the report changed to: 4 2 1 3. After the second manager the report changed to: 2 4 1 3. This report was handed over to Blake.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nHappy new year! The year 2020 is also known as Year Gyeongja (\uacbd\uc790\ub144, gyeongja-nyeon) in Korea. Where did the name come from? Let's briefly look at the Gapja system, which is traditionally used in Korea to name the years.\n\nThere are two sequences of $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_{n}$ and $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, t_3, \\ldots, t_{m}$. These strings contain only lowercase letters. There might be duplicates among these strings.\n\nLet's call a concatenation of strings $x$ and $y$ as the string that is obtained by writing down strings $x$ and $y$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the strings \"code\" and \"forces\" is the string \"codeforces\".\n\nThe year 1 has a name which is the concatenation of the two strings $s_1$ and $t_1$. When the year increases by one, we concatenate the next two strings in order from each of the respective sequences. If the string that is currently being used is at the end of its sequence, we go back to the first string in that sequence.\n\nFor example, if $n = 3, m = 4, s = ${\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}, $t =$ {\"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"}, the following table denotes the resulting year names. Note that the names of the years may repeat. [Image] \n\nYou are given two sequences of strings of size $n$ and $m$ and also $q$ queries. For each query, you will be given the current year. Could you find the name corresponding to the given year, according to the Gapja system?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n, m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 20$).\n\nThe next line contains $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{n}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$.\n\nThe next line contains $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{m}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$.\n\nAmong the given $n + m$ strings may be duplicates (that is, they are not necessarily all different).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 2\\,020$).\n\nIn the next $q$ lines, an integer $y$ ($1 \\le y \\le 10^9$) is given, denoting the year we want to know the name for.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ lines. For each line, print the name of the year as per the rule described above.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n10 12\nsin im gye gap eul byeong jeong mu gi gyeong\nyu sul hae ja chuk in myo jin sa o mi sin\n14\n1\n2\n3\n4\n10\n11\n12\n13\n73\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n\nOutput\nsinyu\nimsul\ngyehae\ngapja\ngyeongo\nsinmi\nimsin\ngyeyu\ngyeyu\nbyeongsin\njeongyu\nmusul\ngihae\ngyeongja\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example denotes the actual names used in the Gapja system.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nKevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is $\\operatorname{max}(0.3 x,(1 - \\frac{m}{250}) x - 50 w)$. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, where m_{i} (0 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, where w_{i} (0 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers h_{s} and h_{u} (0 \u2264 h_{s}, h_{u} \u2264 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n20 40 60 80 100\n0 1 2 3 4\n1 0\n\nOutput\n4900\n\nInput\n119 119 119 119 119\n0 0 0 0 0\n10 0\n\nOutput\n4930\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets $(1 - \\frac{119}{250}) = \\frac{131}{250}$ of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is $\\frac{131}{250}(500 + 1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500) = 3930$. Adding in 10\u00b7100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

Rows are numbered from top to bottom with integers from 1 to n, while columns are numbered from left to right with integers from 1 to m. Initially, all cells are painted in color 0.\n\nYour program has to support two operations:   Paint all cells in row r_{i} in color a_{i};  Paint all cells in column c_{i} in color a_{i}. \n\nIf during some operation i there is a cell that have already been painted, the color of this cell also changes to a_{i}.\n\nYour program has to print the resulting table after k operation.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1  \u2264  n,  m  \u2264 5000, n\u00b7m \u2264 100 000, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 100 000)\u00a0\u2014 the dimensions of the sheet and the number of operations, respectively.\n\nEach of the next k lines contains the description of exactly one query:   1\u00a0r_{i}\u00a0a_{i} (1 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), means that row r_{i} is painted in color a_{i};  2\u00a0c_{i}\u00a0a_{i} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9), means that column c_{i} is painted in color a_{i}. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint n lines containing m integers each\u00a0\u2014 the resulting table after all operations are applied.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 3 3\n1 1 3\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n\nOutput\n3 1 3 \n2 2 2 \n0 1 0 \n\nInput\n5 3 5\n1 1 1\n1 3 1\n1 5 1\n2 1 1\n2 3 1\n\nOutput\n1 1 1 \n1 0 1 \n1 1 1 \n1 0 1 \n1 1 1 \n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe figure below shows all three operations for the first sample step by step.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nManao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.\n\nThere are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n\u00b7(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.\n\nYou know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 30). Each of the following n lines contains a pair of distinct space-separated integers h_{i}, a_{i} (1 \u2264 h_{i}, a_{i} \u2264 100) \u2014 the colors of the i-th team's home and guest uniforms, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print the number of games where the host team is going to play in the guest uniform.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 2\n2 4\n3 4\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n4\n100 42\n42 100\n5 42\n100 5\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n2\n1 2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case the championship consists of 6 games. The only game with the event in question is the game between teams 2 and 1 on the stadium of team 2.\n\nIn the second test sample the host team will have to wear guest uniform in the games between teams: 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 2 (the host team is written first).\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

The function uses a parity variable to keep track of the parity of the number of differences between the current substring and `b`. The parity is updated as the function slides the window of the substring over `a`. The function returns the total number of substrings with even parity.

It calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, and then uses the `math.ceil` function to round up the result of dividing the difference by 10, effectively giving the minimum number of moves required to obtain `b` from `a`.

Also, you think that the difference between difficulties of the easiest and the hardest of the chosen problems must be at least x.\n\nFind the number of ways to choose a problemset for the contest.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains four integers n, l, r, x (1 \u2264 n \u2264 15, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 x \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the number of problems you have, the minimum and maximum value of total difficulty of the problemset and the minimum difference in difficulty between the hardest problem in the pack and the easiest one, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_{n} (1 \u2264 c_{i} \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the difficulty of each problem.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of ways to choose a suitable problemset for the contest. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5 6 1\n1 2 3\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n4 40 50 10\n10 20 30 25\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5 25 35 10\n10 10 20 10 20\n\nOutput\n6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example two sets are suitable, one consisting of the second and third problem, another one consisting of all three problems.\n\nIn the second example, two sets of problems are suitable \u2014 the set of problems with difficulties 10 and 30 as well as the set of problems with difficulties 20 and 30.\n\nIn the third example any set consisting of one problem of difficulty 10 and one problem of difficulty 20 is suitable.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [
        [
            "<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nn, l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nc.sort()\nans = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(i + 1, n):\n        if c[j] - c[i] < x:\n            continue\n        for k in range(2 ** (j - i + 1)):\n            s = 0\n            for t in range(i, j + 1):\n                if (k >> (t - i)) & 1:\n                    s += c[t]\n            if l <= s <= r:\n                ans += 1\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\nHowever, the above solution is not efficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution can be achieved using dynamic programming.\n\n```python\nn, l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\nc = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nc.sort()\nans = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    dp = [0] * (r + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    for j in range(i + 1, n):\n        if c[j] - c[i] < x:\n            continue\n        for k in range(r, c[j] - 1, -1):\n            dp[k] += dp[k - c[j]]\n        ans += sum(dp[l:r + 1])\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n^2 * r), which is much more efficient than the previous solution."
