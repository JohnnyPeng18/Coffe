Thus, `dp[i][j]` can be computed as the sum of `dp[i-1][k]` for all valid \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Result**: The total number of valid sequences of length \\( n \\) is the sum of `dp[n][j]` for all \\( j \\) from 1 to \\( m \\).\n\nHere is the Python function implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n):\n    # Initialize the dp table with zeros\n    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Base case: sequences of length 1\n    for j in range(1, m + 1):\n        dp[1][j] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the dp table\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(1, m + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = sum(dp[i-1][k] for k in range(1, j//2 + 1))\n    \n    # The result is the sum of all dp[n][j] for j from 1 to m\n    return sum(dp[n][j] for j in range(1, m + 1))\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(get_total_number_of_sequences(10, 3))  # Example call to the function\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a 2D list `dp` with dimensions \\((n+1) \\times (m+1)\\) to store the number of valid sequences.\n- **Base Case**: We set `dp[1][j] = 1` for all \\( j \\) from 1 to \\( m \\) because any single number is a valid sequence of length 1.\n- **Transition**: For each length \\( i \\) from 2 to \\( n \\) and each possible ending number \\( j \\) from 1 to \\( m \\), we compute `dp[i][j]` by summing up all `dp[i-1][k]` where \\( k \\leq j/2 \\).\n- **Result**: Finally, we sum up all `dp[n][j]` for \\( j \\) from 1 to \\( m \\) to get the total number of valid sequences of length \\( n \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid sequences using dynamic programming."

In Python, the AND operation is typically used with boolean values or integers.\n\nHere's a function that performs the elementwise AND operation on two tuples:\n\n```python\ndef and_tuples(test_tup1, test_tup2):\n    # Ensure both tuples are of the same length\n    if len(test_tup1) != len(test_tup2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both tuples must be of the same length\")\n    \n    # Perform elementwise AND operation\n    result = tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ntest_tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)\ntest_tup2 = (4, 3, 2, 1)\nprint(and_tuples(test_tup1, test_tup2))  # Output: (0, 2, 2, 0)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the lengths of the two tuples are the same. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.\n2. **Elementwise AND Operation**: Using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor, the function iterates over pairs of elements from the two tuples (using `zip`) and applies the `&` operator to each pair.\n3. **Return Result**: The result is a new tuple containing the results of the elementwise AND operations.\n\n### Example:\nFor the tuples `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(4, 3, 2, 1)`, the elementwise AND operation would be:\n- `1 & 4` which is `0`\n- `2 & 3` which is `2`\n- `3 & 2` which is `2`\n- `4 & 1` which is `0`\n\nThus, the resulting tuple is `(0, 2, 2, 0)`.\n\nFeel free to test the function with other tuples to ensure it works as expected!"

        [
            "Certainly! To solve this problem, we need to understand how rotations affect the array and how to efficiently determine the element at a given index after a series of rotations.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand Rotations**: A rotation operation on an array shifts elements to the right or left. For example, a right rotation on `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` results in `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n\n2. **Ranges of Rotations**: The `ranges` parameter specifies the subarrays to be rotated. Each range is a tuple `(start, end)` indicating the subarray `arr[start:end+1]`.\n\n3. **Number of Rotations**: The `rotations` parameter specifies how many times each subarray should be rotated.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of actually rotating the array multiple times, we can calculate the final position of the index after all rotations.\n\nHere's the Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef find_Element(arr, ranges, rotations, index):\n    n = len(arr)\n    \n    # Iterate over the ranges and rotations in reverse order\n    for (start, end), rotation in zip(reversed(ranges), reversed(rotations)):\n        length = end - start + 1\n        # Normalize the rotation to avoid unnecessary full rotations\n        rotation = rotation % length\n        \n        # If the index is within the current range\n        if start <= index <= end:\n            # Calculate the new index after the rotation\n            index = start + (index - start - rotation) % length\n    \n    return arr[index]\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nranges = [(0, 2), (0, 3)]\nrotations = [1, 2]\nindex = 1\nprint(find_Element(arr, ranges, rotations, index))  # Output should be 3\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reverse Iteration**: We iterate over the ranges and rotations in reverse order because we need to trace back the index to its original position before any rotations were applied.\n2. **Normalization**: We normalize the number of rotations to avoid unnecessary full rotations using `rotation % length`.\n3. **Index Adjustment**: If the index falls within the current range, we adjust the index based on the rotation. The formula `(index - start - rotation) % length` helps in finding the new position within the subarray.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the element at the given index after all rotations without actually modifying the array multiple times."

The `range(0, len(arr), 2)` ensures that we only consider even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).\n3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, we check if the number at the current index is even using `arr[index] % 2 == 0`.\n4. **Summation**: If the number is even, we add it to `total_sum`.\n5. **Return**: Finally, we return the `total_sum`.\n\nThis function efficiently computes the desired sum by iterating through the list only once and checking the necessary conditions."
