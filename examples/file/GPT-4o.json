A single set contains values of any immutable data type.\n\nCREATING SETS\n\n>> myset = {1, 2} # Directly assigning values to a set\n>> myset = set()  # Initializing a set\n>> myset = set(['a', 'b']) # Creating a set from a list\n>> myset\n{'a', 'b'}\n\n\nMODIFYING SETS\n\nUsing the add() function:\n\n>> myset.add('c')\n>> myset\n{'a', 'c', 'b'}\n>> myset.add('a') # As 'a' already exists in the set, nothing happens\n>> myset.add((5, 4))\n>> myset\n{'a', 'c', 'b', (5, 4)}\n\n\nUsing the update() function:\n\n>> myset.update([1, 2, 3, 4]) # update() only works for iterable objects\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 2, (5, 4), 3}\n>> myset.update({1, 7, 8})\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 3}\n>> myset.update({1, 6}, [5, 13])\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 13, 3}\n\n\nREMOVING ITEMS\n\nBoth the discard() and remove() functions take a single value as an argument and removes that value from the set. If that value is not present, discard() does nothing, but remove() will raise a KeyError exception.\n\n>> myset.discard(10)\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 13, 11, 3}\n>> myset.remove(13)\n>> myset\n{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 11, 3}\n\n\nCOMMON SET OPERATIONS Using union(), intersection() and difference() functions.\n\n>> a = {2, 4, 5, 9}\n>> b = {2, 4, 11, 12}\n>> a.union(b) # Values which exist in a or b\n{2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12}\n>> a.intersection(b) # Values which exist in a and b\n{2, 4}\n>> a.difference(b) # Values which exist in a but not in b\n{9, 5}\n\n\nThe union() and intersection() functions are symmetric methods:\n\n>> a.union(b) == b.union(a)\nTrue\n>> a.intersection(b) == b.intersection(a)\nTrue\n>> a.difference(b) == b.difference(a)\nFalse\n\nThese other built-in data structures in Python are also useful.\n\n=====Problem Statement=====\nGiven 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.\n\n=====Input Format=====\nThe first line of input contains an integer, M.\nThe second line contains M space-separated integers.\nThe third line contains an integer, N.\nThe fourth line contains N space-separated integers. \n\n=====Output Format=====\nOutput the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, one per line.\nPlease write a Python function None for the task.\n```python": [

            "To solve the problem of finding the symmetric difference between two sets and printing the result in ascending order, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Read the input values.\n2. Convert the input values into sets.\n3. Compute the symmetric difference between the two sets.\n4. Sort the symmetric difference.\n5. Print each element of the sorted symmetric difference.\n\nHere's the complete Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef symmetric_difference():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    M = int(data[0])\n    set_M = set(map(int, data[1:M+1]))\n    \n    N = int(data[M+1])\n    set_N = set(map(int, data[M+2:M+2+N]))\n    \n    sym_diff = set_M.symmetric_difference(set_N)\n    sorted_sym_diff = sorted(sym_diff)\n    \n    for num in sorted_sym_diff:\n        print(num)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Reading Input:**\n   - We use `sys.stdin.read` to read all input at once and then split it into a list of strings.\n   - The first element is the size of the first set `M`.\n   - The next `M` elements are the elements of the first set `set_M`.\n   - The element after the first set is the size of the second set `N`.\n   - The next `N` elements are the elements of the second set `set_N`.\n\n2. **Creating Sets:**\n   - We convert the appropriate slices of the input list into sets using `map(int, ...)` to convert the strings to integers.\n\n3. **Computing Symmetric Difference:**\n   - We use the `symmetric_difference` method to find elements that are in either `set_M` or `set_N` but not in both.\n\n4. **Sorting and Printing:**\n   - We sort the symmetric difference and print each element on a new line.\n\nThis function assumes that the input is provided via standard input, which is typical for competitive programming and some coding environments. If you are running this in a different environment, you might need to adjust the input method accordingly."

You have to generate a list of the first N fibonacci numbers, 0 being the first number. Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list.\n\nConcept\n\nThe map() function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. It takes two parameters: first, the function that is to be applied and secondly, the iterables.\nLet's say you are given a list of names, and you have to print a list that contains the length of each name.\n\n>> print (list(map(len, ['Tina', 'Raj', 'Tom'])))  \n[4, 3, 3]  \n\nLambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function.

It proves very handy in functional and GUI programming.\n\n>> sum = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c\n>> sum(1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nNote:\n\nLambda functions cannot use the return statement and can only have a single expression.

            "Sure, let's break down the task step by step and then implement the solution in Python.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We need a function to generate the first `N` Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Cube the Fibonacci Numbers**: Use the `map` function along with a `lambda` expression to cube each Fibonacci number.\n3. **Print the Result**: Print the list of cubed Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Implementation\n\n1. **Fibonacci Function**: We'll create a function `fibonacci(n)` that returns a list of the first `N` Fibonacci numbers.\n2. **Cubing with Map and Lambda**: We'll use `map` and `lambda` to cube each number in the list of Fibonacci numbers.\n3. **Print the Result**: Finally, we'll print the resulting list.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return []\n    elif n == 1:\n        return [0]\n    elif n == 2:\n        return [0, 1]\n    \n    fibs = [0, 1]\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])\n    return fibs\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    \n    fibs = fibonacci(N)\n    cubed_fibs = list(map(lambda x: x**3, fibs))\n    print(cubed_fibs)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Fibonacci Function**:\n   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, return an empty list.\n   - If `n` is 1, return `[0]`.\n   - If `n` is 2, return `[0, 1]`.\n   - For `n > 2`, generate the Fibonacci sequence iteratively and append each new number to the list.\n\n2. **Main Function**:\n   - Read the input value `N`.\n   - Generate the first `N` Fibonacci numbers using the `fibonacci` function.\n   - Use `map` and `lambda` to cube each Fibonacci number.\n   - Print the resulting list of cubed Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Usage\n\nTo use this script, you would typically run it in an environment where you can provide input via standard input (e.g., a terminal or a coding competition platform). The script reads the input, processes it, and prints the output as specified.\n\nThis solution is efficient and leverages Python's functional programming capabilities with `map` and `lambda` to achieve the desired result concisely."

The rooms are numbered from $0$ to $9$ from left to right.\n\nThe hotel has two entrances \u2014 one from the left end, and another from the right end. When a customer arrives to the hotel through the left entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the left entrance. Similarly, when a customer arrives at the hotel through the right entrance, they are assigned to an empty room closest to the right entrance.\n\nOne day, Amugae lost the room assignment list. Thankfully Amugae's memory is perfect, and he remembers all of the customers: when a customer arrived, from which entrance, and when they left the hotel. Initially the hotel was empty. Write a program that recovers the room assignment list from Amugae's memory.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line consists of an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$), the number of events in Amugae's memory.\n\nThe second line consists of a string of length $n$ describing the events in chronological order.

'0', '1', ..., '9': The customer in room $x$ ($0$, $1$, ..., $9$ respectively) leaves. \n\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one empty room when a customer arrives, and there is a customer in the room $x$ when $x$ ($0$, $1$, ..., $9$) is given. Also, all the rooms are initially empty.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the only line, output the hotel room's assignment status, from room $0$ to room $9$.

First of all, all rooms are empty. Assignment status is 0000000000.  L: a customer arrives to the hotel through the left entrance. Assignment status is 1000000000.  L: one more customer from the left entrance. Assignment status is 1100000000.  R: one more customer from the right entrance. Assignment status is 1100000001.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nAyush is a cashier at the shopping center. Recently his department has started a ''click and collect\" service which allows users to shop online. \n\nThe store contains k items. n customers have already used the above service. Each user paid for m items. Let a_{ij} denote the j-th item in the i-th person's order.\n\nDue to the space limitations all the items are arranged in one single row.

We perform the following operation with it: replace pairs $(a_{2i+1}, a_{2i+2})$ with $(a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2})\\bmod 10$ for $0\\le i<2^{k-1}$. For every $i$ where $a_{2i+1} + a_{2i+2}\\ge 10$ we get a candy! As a result, we will get a sequence of length $2^{k-1}$.\n\nLess formally, we partition sequence of length $2^k$ into $2^{k-1}$ pairs, each consisting of 2 numbers: the first pair consists of the first and second numbers, the second of the third and fourth $\\ldots$, the last pair consists of the ($2^k-1$)-th and ($2^k$)-th numbers. For every pair such that sum of numbers in it is at least $10$, we get a candy. After that, we replace every pair of numbers with a remainder of the division of their sum by $10$ (and don't change the order of the numbers).\n\nPerform this operation with a resulting array until it becomes of length $1$. Let $f([a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{2^k}])$ denote the number of candies we get in this process. \n\nFor example: if the starting sequence is $[8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]$ then:\n\nAfter the first operation the sequence becomes $[(8 + 7)\\bmod 10, (3 + 1)\\bmod 10, (7 + 0)\\bmod 10, (9 + 4)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[5, 4, 7, 3]$, and we get $2$ candies as $8 + 7 \\ge 10$ and $9 + 4 \\ge 10$.\n\nAfter the second operation the sequence becomes $[(5 + 4)\\bmod 10, (7 + 3)\\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9, 0]$, and we get one more candy as $7 + 3 \\ge 10$. \n\nAfter the final operation sequence becomes $[(9 + 0) \\bmod 10]$ $=$ $[9]$. \n\nTherefore, $f([8, 7, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 4]) = 3$ as we got $3$ candies in total.\n\nYou are given a sequence of digits of length $n$ $s_1, s_2, \\ldots s_n$.

Where did the name come from? Let's briefly look at the Gapja system, which is traditionally used in Korea to name the years.\n\nThere are two sequences of $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, s_3, \\ldots, s_{n}$ and $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, t_3, \\ldots, t_{m}$. These strings contain only lowercase letters. There might be duplicates among these strings.\n\nLet's call a concatenation of strings $x$ and $y$ as the string that is obtained by writing down strings $x$ and $y$ one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the strings \"code\" and \"forces\" is the string \"codeforces\".\n\nThe year 1 has a name which is the concatenation of the two strings $s_1$ and $t_1$. When the year increases by one, we concatenate the next two strings in order from each of the respective sequences. If the string that is currently being used is at the end of its sequence, we go back to the first string in that sequence.\n\nFor example, if $n = 3, m = 4, s = ${\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}, $t =$ {\"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\"}, the following table denotes the resulting year names. Note that the names of the years may repeat. [Image] \n\nYou are given two sequences of strings of size $n$ and $m$ and also $q$ queries. For each query, you will be given the current year. Could you find the name corresponding to the given year, according to the Gapja system?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n, m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 20$).\n\nThe next line contains $n$ strings $s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_{n}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$.\n\nThe next line contains $m$ strings $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{m}$. Each string contains only lowercase letters, and they are separated by spaces. The length of each string is at least $1$ and at most $10$.\n\nAmong the given $n + m$ strings may be duplicates (that is, they are not necessarily all different).\n\nThe next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 2\\,020$).\n\nIn the next $q$ lines, an integer $y$ ($1 \\le y \\le 10^9$) is given, denoting the year we want to know the name for.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ lines. For each line, print the name of the year as per the rule described above.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n10 12\nsin im gye gap eul byeong jeong mu gi gyeong\nyu sul hae ja chuk in myo jin sa o mi sin\n14\n1\n2\n3\n4\n10\n11\n12\n13\n73\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n\nOutput\nsinyu\nimsul\ngyehae\ngapja\ngyeongo\nsinmi\nimsin\ngyeyu\ngyeyu\nbyeongsin\njeongyu\nmusul\ngihae\ngyeongja\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first example denotes the actual names used in the Gapja system.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nKevin Sun has just finished competing in Codeforces Round #334! The round was 120 minutes long and featured five problems with maximum point values of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500, respectively. Despite the challenging tasks, Kevin was uncowed and bulldozed through all of them, distinguishing himself from the herd as the best cowmputer scientist in all of Bovinia. Kevin knows his submission time for each problem, the number of wrong submissions that he made on each problem, and his total numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks. Because Codeforces scoring is complicated, Kevin wants you to write a program to compute his final score.\n\nCodeforces scores are computed as follows: If the maximum point value of a problem is x, and Kevin submitted correctly at minute m but made w wrong submissions, then his score on that problem is $\\operatorname{max}(0.3 x,(1 - \\frac{m}{250}) x - 50 w)$. His total score is equal to the sum of his scores for each problem. In addition, Kevin's total score gets increased by 100 points for each successful hack, but gets decreased by 50 points for each unsuccessful hack.\n\nAll arithmetic operations are performed with absolute precision and no rounding. It is guaranteed that Kevin's final score is an integer.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains five space-separated integers m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4, m_5, where m_{i} (0 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 119) is the time of Kevin's last submission for problem i. His last submission is always correct and gets accepted.\n\nThe second line contains five space-separated integers w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, where w_{i} (0 \u2264 w_{i} \u2264 10) is Kevin's number of wrong submissions on problem i.\n\nThe last line contains two space-separated integers h_{s} and h_{u} (0 \u2264 h_{s}, h_{u} \u2264 20), denoting the Kevin's numbers of successful and unsuccessful hacks, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer, the value of Kevin's final score.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n20 40 60 80 100\n0 1 2 3 4\n1 0\n\nOutput\n4900\n\nInput\n119 119 119 119 119\n0 0 0 0 0\n10 0\n\nOutput\n4930\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the second sample, Kevin takes 119 minutes on all of the problems. Therefore, he gets $(1 - \\frac{119}{250}) = \\frac{131}{250}$ of the points on each problem. So his score from solving problems is $\\frac{131}{250}(500 + 1000 + 1500 + 2000 + 2500) = 3930$. Adding in 10\u00b7100 = 1000 points from hacks, his total score becomes 3930 + 1000 = 4930.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

If two magnets are put together at a close distance, then the like poles will repel each other and the opposite poles will attract each other.\n\nMike starts by laying one magnet horizontally on the table. During each following step Mike adds one more magnet horizontally to the right end of the row. Depending on how Mike puts the magnet on the table, it is either attracted to the previous one (forming a group of multiple magnets linked together) or repelled by it (then Mike lays this magnet at some distance to the right from the previous one). We assume that a sole magnet not linked to others forms a group of its own. [Image] \n\nMike arranged multiple magnets in a row. Determine the number of groups that the magnets formed.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000) \u2014 the number of magnets. Then n lines follow. The i-th line (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) contains either characters \"01\", if Mike put the i-th magnet in the \"plus-minus\" position, or characters \"10\", if Mike put the magnet in the \"minus-plus\" position.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOn the single line of the output print the number of groups of magnets.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n10\n10\n10\n01\n10\n10\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n4\n01\n01\n10\n10\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first testcase corresponds to the figure.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nMahmoud and Ehab continue their adventures! As everybody in the evil land knows, Dr. Evil likes bipartite graphs, especially trees.\n\nA tree is a connected acyclic graph. A bipartite graph is a graph, whose vertices can be partitioned into 2 sets in such a way, that for each edge (u, v) that belongs to the graph, u and v belong to different sets. You can find more formal definitions of a tree and a bipartite graph in the notes section below.\n\nDr. Evil gave Mahmoud and Ehab a tree consisting of n nodes and asked them to add edges to it in such a way, that the graph is still bipartite. Besides, after adding these edges the graph should be simple (doesn't contain loops or multiple edges). What is the maximum number of edges they can add?\n\nA loop is an edge, which connects a node with itself.

When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\n'Twas the night before Christmas, and Santa's frantically setting up his new Christmas tree! There are n nodes in the tree, connected by n-1 edges. On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation.\n\n<image>\n\nHe has m elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, a and b, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\n\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned (a_i, b_i), as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of 1's when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\n\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains one integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, n and m (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5; 1 \u2264 m \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the size of tree and the number of elves respectively.\n\nThe next n-1 lines of each test case each contains three integers, x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; -1 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 meaning that there's an edge between nodes x and y. If \n\n  * v = -1: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. \n  * v \u2265 0: The set of lights on the edge is v. \n\n\n\nThe next m lines of each test case each contains three integers, a, b, and p (1 \u2264 a, b \u2264 n; a \u2260 b; 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1) \u2014 the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all n and the sum of all m don't exceed 2 \u22c5 10^5 each.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. \n\nIf the answer is YES, print n-1 lines each containing three integers: x, y, and v (1 \u2264 x, y \u2264 n; 0 \u2264 v < 2^{30}) \u2014 the edge and the integer on that edge. The set of edges must be the same as in the input, and if the value of some edge was specified earlier, it can not change. You can print the edges in any order.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n6 5\n1 2 -1\n1 3 1\n4 2 7\n6 3 0\n2 5 -1\n2 3 1\n2 5 0\n5 6 1\n6 1 1\n4 5 1\n5 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 4 1\n4 5 -1\n2 4 0\n3 4 1\n2 3 1\n3 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 3 0\n2 1\n1 2 1\n1 2 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nYES\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 4 7\n3 6 0\n2 5 0\nYES\n1 2 1\n1 3 0\n1 4 1\n4 5 1\nNO\nNO\n\nNote\n\nThe first test case is the image in the statement.\n\nOne possible answer is assigning the value of the edge (1, 2) to 5, and the value of the edge (2, 5) to 3. This is correct because: \n\n  * The first elf goes from node 2 to node 3. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the value 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The second elf goes from node 2 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 3, so he remembers the value 0 (as 3 has an even number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The third elf goes from node 5 to node 6. This elf's favorite number is 7, so he remembers the value 1 (as 7 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fourth elf goes from node 6 to node 1. This elf's favorite number is 1, so he remembers the value 1 (as 1 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n  * The fifth elf goes from node 4 to node 5. This elf's favorite number is 4, so he remembers the number 1 (as 4 has an odd number of 1 bits in its binary representation). \n\n\n\nNote that there are other possible answers.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nA binary tree of n nodes is given. Nodes of the tree are numbered from 1 to n and the root is the node 1. Each node can have no child, only one left child, only one right child, or both children. For convenience, let's denote l_u and r_u as the left and the right child of the node u respectively, l_u = 0 if u does not have the left child, and r_u = 0 if the node u does not have the right child.\n\nEach node has a string label, initially is a single character c_u. Let's define the string representation of the binary tree as the concatenation of the labels of the nodes in the in-order. Formally, let f(u) be the string representation of the tree rooted at the node u. f(u) is defined as follows: $$$ f(u) = \\begin{cases} <empty string>, & if u = 0; \\\\\\ f(l_u) + c_u + f(r_u) & otherwise, \\end{cases}  where +$$$ denotes the string concatenation operation.\n\nThis way, the string representation of the tree is f(1).\n\nFor each node, we can duplicate its label at most once, that is, assign c_u with c_u + c_u, but only if u is the root of the tree, or if its parent also has its label duplicated.\n\nYou are given the tree and an integer k. What is the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree, if we can duplicate labels of at most k nodes?\n\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of the following holds: \n\n  * a is a prefix of b, but a \u2260 b; \n  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5).\n\nThe second line contains a string c of n lower-case English letters, where c_i is the initial label of the node i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Note that the given string c is not the initial string representation of the tree.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (0 \u2264 l_i, r_i \u2264 n). If the node i does not have the left child, l_i = 0, and if the node i does not have the right child, r_i = 0.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given input forms a binary tree, rooted at 1.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single line, containing the lexicographically smallest string representation of the tree if at most k nodes have their labels duplicated.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n4 3\nabab\n2 3\n0 0\n0 4\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nbaaaab\n\nInput\n\n\n8 2\nkadracyn\n2 5\n3 4\n0 0\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndaarkkcyan\n\nInput\n\n\n8 3\nkdaracyn\n2 5\n0 3\n0 4\n0 0\n6 8\n0 7\n0 0\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\ndarkcyan\n\nNote\n\nThe images below present the tree for the examples. The number in each node is the node number, while the subscripted letter is its label. To the right is the string representation of the tree, with each letter having the same color as the corresponding node.\n\nHere is the tree for the first example. Here we duplicated the labels of nodes 1 and 3. We should not duplicate the label of node 2 because it would give us the string \"bbaaab\", which is lexicographically greater than \"baaaab\".\n\n<image>\n\nIn the second example, we can duplicate the labels of nodes 1 and 2. Note that only duplicating the label of the root will produce a worse result than the initial string.\n\n<image>\n\nIn the third example, we should not duplicate any character at all.

Thus, the following is a solution sequence that gives a minimum travel distance: 0 \u2192 2 \u2192 0 \u2192 4 \u2192 0 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 1 \u2192 0 \u2192 5, where each 0 means you go the origin and grab one bag, and each positive integer means you deliver the bag to a depot at this coordinate, giving a total distance of 25 units. It must be noted that there are other sequences that give the same distance.\n\nIn the second test case, you can follow the following sequence, among multiple such sequences, to travel minimum distance: 0 \u2192 6 \u2192 8 \u2192 7 \u2192 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 0 \u2192 (-5) \u2192 (-10) \u2192 (-15), with distance 41.

You are curious about the following scenario: If you were to label each edge with a color, what is the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that all paths of length k or longer are rainbow paths?\n\nTeucer wants to surprise his older brother with a map of Liyue. He also wants to know a valid coloring of edges that uses the minimum number of colors. Please help him with this task!\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains two integers n and k (2 \u2264 k < n \u2264 1000). \n\nOutput\n\nOn the first line, output c, the minimum colors you need to satisfy the above requirements.\n\nOn the second line, print a valid edge coloring as an array of (n(n-1))/(2) integers ranging from 1 to c. Exactly c distinct colors should exist in the construction. Print the edges in increasing order by the start node first, then by the second node.\n\nFor example, if n=4, the edge colors will correspond to this order of edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n5 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3 2 2 1 2 2 1 3 1 1 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n8 7\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 2 2 \n\nNote\n\nThe corresponding construction for the first test case looks like this: \n\n<image> It is impossible to satisfy the constraints with less than 2 colors.\n\nThe corresponding construction for the second test case looks like this: \n\n<image> One can show there exists no construction using less than 3 colors.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nFrog Gorf is traveling through Swamp kingdom. Unfortunately, after a poor jump, he fell into a well of n meters depth. Now Gorf is on the bottom of the well and has a long way up.\n\nThe surface of the well's walls vary in quality: somewhere they are slippery, but somewhere have convenient ledges. In other words, if Gorf is on x meters below ground level, then in one jump he can go up on any integer distance from 0 to a_x meters inclusive. (Note that Gorf can't jump down, only up).\n\nUnfortunately, Gorf has to take a break after each jump (including jump on 0 meters). And after jumping up to position x meters below ground level, he'll slip exactly b_x meters down while resting.\n\nCalculate the minimum number of jumps Gorf needs to reach ground level.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 300 000) \u2014 the depth of the well.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 i), where a_i is the maximum height Gorf can jump from i meters below ground level.\n\nThe third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \u2026, b_n (0 \u2264 b_i \u2264 n - i), where b_i is the distance Gorf will slip down if he takes a break on i meters below ground level.\n\nOutput\n\nIf Gorf can't reach ground level, print -1. Otherwise, firstly print integer k \u2014 the minimum possible number of jumps.\n\nThen print the sequence d_1,\\,d_2, \u2026,\\,d_k where d_j is the depth Gorf'll reach after the j-th jump, but before he'll slip down during the break. Ground level is equal to 0.\n\nIf there are multiple answers, print any of them.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n3\n0 2 2\n1 1 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n2\n1 0 \n\n\nInput\n\n\n2\n1 1\n1 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n-1\n\n\nInput\n\n\n10\n0 1 2 3 5 5 6 7 8 5\n9 8 7 1 5 4 3 2 0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n9 4 0 \n\nNote\n\nIn the first example, Gorf is on the bottom of the well and jump to the height 1 meter below ground level. After that he slip down by meter and stays on height 2 meters below ground level. Now, from here, he can reach ground level in one jump.\n\nIn the second example, Gorf can jump to one meter below ground level, but will slip down back to the bottom of the well. That's why he can't reach ground level.\n\nIn the third example, Gorf can reach ground level only from the height 5 meters below the ground level. And Gorf can reach this height using a series of jumps 10 \u21d2 9 \\dashrightarrow 9 \u21d2 4 \\dashrightarrow 5 where \u21d2 is the jump and \\dashrightarrow is slipping during breaks.\nDo not give explanations, only give the Python code.\nPython Solution:\n```python": [

A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements [3, 4, 4] currently in the deque, adding an element 1 to the beginning will produce the sequence [\\color{red}{1}, 3, 4, 4], and adding the same element to the end will produce [3, 4, 4, \\color{red}{1}].\n\nThe elements of the array are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with a_1 and finishing with a_n. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or to the end.\n\nFor example, if we consider an array a = [3, 7, 5, 5], one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:    1. |  add 3 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{3}] in it;   \n---|---|---  \n  2. |  add 7 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, \\color{red}{7}] in it;   \n  3. |  add 5 to the end of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [3, 7, \\color{red}{5}] in it;   \n  4. |  add 5 to the beginning of the deque: |  deque has a sequence [\\color{red}{5}, 3, 7, 5] in it;   \n  \nFind the minimal possible number of inversions in the deque after the whole array is processed. \n\nAn inversion in sequence d is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and d_i > d_j.

Making a jump from a point with coordinate x with a distance d to the left moves the grasshopper to a point with a coordinate x - d, while jumping to the right moves him to a point with a coordinate x + d.\n\nThe grasshopper is very fond of positive integers, so for each integer i starting with 1 the following holds: exactly i minutes after the start he makes a jump with a distance of exactly i. So, in the first minutes he jumps by 1, then by 2, and so on.\n\nThe direction of a jump is determined as follows: if the point where the grasshopper was before the jump has an even coordinate, the grasshopper jumps to the left, otherwise he jumps to the right.\n\nFor example, if after 18 consecutive jumps he arrives at the point with a coordinate 7, he will jump by a distance of 19 to the right, since 7 is an odd number, and will end up at a point 7 + 19 = 26. Since 26 is an even number, the next jump the grasshopper will make to the left by a distance of 20, and it will move him to the point 26 - 20 = 6.\n\nFind exactly which point the grasshopper will be at after exactly n jumps.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10^4) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the following t lines contains two integers x_0 (-10^{14} \u2264 x_0 \u2264 10^{14}) and n (0 \u2264 n \u2264 10^{14}) \u2014 the coordinate of the grasshopper's initial position and the number of jumps.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint exactly t lines.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nThe new generation external memory contains an array of integers a[1 \u2026 n] = [a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n].\n\nThis type of memory does not support changing the value of an arbitrary element. Instead, it allows you to cut out any segment of the given array, cyclically shift (rotate) it by any offset and insert it back into the same place.\n\nTechnically, each cyclic shift consists of two consecutive actions: \n\n  1. You may select arbitrary indices l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) as the boundaries of the segment. \n  2. Then you replace the segment a[l \u2026 r] with it's cyclic shift to the left by an arbitrary offset d. The concept of a cyclic shift can be also explained by following relations: the sequence [1, 4, 1, 3] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 1 and the sequence [4, 1, 3, 1] is a cyclic shift of the sequence [3, 1, 4, 1] to the left by the offset 2. \n\n\n\nFor example, if a = [1, \\color{blue}{3, 2, 8}, 5], then choosing l = 2, r = 4 and d = 2 yields a segment a[2 \u2026 4] = [3, 2, 8]. This segment is then shifted by the offset d = 2 to the left, and you get a segment [8, 3, 2] which then takes the place of of the original elements of the segment. In the end you get a = [1, \\color{blue}{8, 3, 2}, 5].\n\nSort the given array a using no more than n cyclic shifts of any of its segments.

The second line consists of space-separated elements of the array a_i (-10^9 \u2264 a_i \u2264 10^9). Elements of array a may repeat and don't have to be unique.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint t answers to all input test cases. \n\nThe first line of the answer of each test case should contain an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of actions to sort the array. The next k lines should contain descriptions of the actions formatted as \"l r d\" (without quotes) where l and r (1 \u2264 l < r \u2264 n) are the boundaries of the segment being shifted, while d (1 \u2264 d \u2264 r - l) is the offset value. Please remember that only the cyclic shifts to the left are considered so the chosen segment will be shifted by the offset d to the to the left.\n\nNote that you are not required to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed for sorting. Any sorting method where the number of shifts does not exceed n will be accepted.\n\nIf the given array a is already sorted, one of the possible answers is k = 0 and an empty sequence of cyclic shifts.\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n2\n2 1\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n2 4 1 3\n5\n2 5 1 4 3\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n1\n1 2 1\n1\n1 3 2\n3\n2 4 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n4\n2 4 2\n1 5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the fourth data set in the example: \n\n  1.

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nThe problem statement looms below, filling you with determination.\n\nConsider a grid in which some cells are empty and some cells are filled. Call a cell in this grid exitable if, starting at that cell, you can exit the grid by moving up and left through only empty cells. This includes the cell itself, so all filled in cells are not exitable. Note that you can exit the grid from any leftmost empty cell (cell in the first column) by going left, and from any topmost empty cell (cell in the first row) by going up.\n\nLet's call a grid determinable if, given only which cells are exitable, we can exactly determine which cells are filled in and which aren't.\n\nYou are given a grid a of dimensions n \u00d7 m , i. e. a grid with n rows and m columns. You need to answer q queries (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5). Each query gives two integers x_1, x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m) and asks whether the subgrid of a consisting of the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^6, nm \u2264 10^6) \u2014 the dimensions of the grid a.\n\nn lines follow. The y-th line contains m characters, the x-th of which is 'X' if the cell on the intersection of the the y-th row and x-th column is filled and \".\" if it is empty.\n\nThe next line contains a single integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 2 \u22c5 10^5) \u2014 the number of queries.\n\nq lines follow. Each line contains two integers x_1 and x_2 (1 \u2264 x_1 \u2264 x_2 \u2264 m), representing a query asking whether the subgrid of a containing the columns x_1, x_1 + 1, \u2026, x_2 - 1, x_2 is determinable.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output one line containing \"YES\" if the subgrid specified by the query is determinable and \"NO\" otherwise.

E  \n    \n\nNote that you can exit the grid by going left from any leftmost cell (or up from any topmost cell); you do not need to reach the top left corner cell to exit the grid.\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the third query: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    X. NN  \n    \n\nThis subgrid cannot be determined only from whether each cell is exitable, because the below grid produces the above \"exitability grid\" as well: \n    \n    \n      \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    XX  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\nFor the fourth query: \n    \n    \n      \n    X N  \n    .

    "You are an expert Python programmer, and here is your task:\nThe statement of this problem shares a lot with problem A. The differences are that in this problem, the probability is introduced, and the constraint is different.\n\nA robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).\n\nIn one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.\n\nEach second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell. \n\nAfter a lot of testings in problem A, the robot is now broken. It cleans the floor as described above, but at each second the cleaning operation is performed with probability \\frac p {100} only, and not performed with probability 1 - \\frac p {100}. The cleaning or not cleaning outcomes are independent each second.\n\nGiven the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the expected time for the robot to do its job.\n\nIt can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \\frac x y, where x and y are integers and y not \u2261 0 \\pmod{10^9 + 7} . Output the integer equal to x \u22c5 y^{-1} mod (10^9 + 7). In other words, output such an integer a that 0 \u2264 a < 10^9 + 7 and a \u22c5 y \u2261 x \\pmod {10^9 + 7}.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 10). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nA test case consists of only one line, containing n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, c_d, and p (4 \u2264 n \u22c5 m \u2264 10^5, n, m \u2265 2, 1 \u2264 r_b, r_d \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 c_b, c_d \u2264 m, 1 \u2264 p \u2264 99) \u2014 the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot, the position of the dirt cell and the probability of cleaning in percentage.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the expected time for the robot to clean the dirty cell, modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n6\n2 2 1 1 2 1 25\n3 3 1 2 2 2 25\n10 10 1 1 10 10 75\n10 10 10 10 1 1 75\n5 5 1 3 2 2 10\n97 98 3 5 41 43 50\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n3\n3\n15\n15\n332103349\n99224487\n\nNote\n\nIn the first test case, the robot has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second. Using the [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution), we can find out that with the success rate of 25\\%, the expected number of tries to clear the dirty cell is \\frac 1 {0.25} = 4. But because the first moment the robot has the opportunity to clean the cell is before the robot starts moving, the answer is 3.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirt cell. The purple square is the initial position of the robot. Each second the robot has an opportunity to clean a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.\n\nIn the second test case, the board size and the position are different, but the robot still has the opportunity to clean the dirty cell every second, and it has the same probability of cleaning. Therefore the answer is the same as in the first example.\n\n<image> Illustration for the second example.\n\nThe third and the fourth case are almost the same. The only difference is that the position of the dirty cell and the robot are swapped.

The mischievous duo is now vandalizing a rooted tree, by coloring the nodes while playing their favorite game.\n\nThe game works as follows: there is a tree of size n, rooted at node 1, where each node is initially white. Red and Blue get one turn each. Red goes first. \n\nIn Red's turn, he can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree red. \n\nHowever, to make the game fair, Red is only allowed to color k nodes of the tree. In other words, after Red's turn, at most k of the nodes can be colored red.\n\nThen, it's Blue's turn. Blue can do the following operation any number of times: \n\n  * Pick any subtree of the rooted tree, and color every node in the subtree blue. However, he's not allowed to choose a subtree that contains a node already colored red, as that would make the node purple and no one likes purple crayon. \n\nNote: there's no restriction on the number of nodes Blue can color, as long as he doesn't color a node that Red has already colored.\n\nAfter the two turns, the score of the game is determined as follows: let w be the number of white nodes, r be the number of red nodes, and b be the number of blue nodes. The score of the game is w \u22c5 (r - b).\n\nRed wants to maximize this score, and Blue wants to minimize it.
